# ExoTransitTracker
Discover ongoing and upcoming exoplanet transit events visible to you.

An exoplanet "transit" occurs when a distant exoplanet crosses in front of its star from your point of view. This is one of the key ways that exoplanets are discovered and studied. 

This is a WIP tool that can query multiple online databases to identify user-provided exoplanet names, determine information about the exoplanet, and use it to determine when that exoplanet will transit next. It can also take into account your location to determine if that transit event is visible or if (for example) the Sun will be up at that time.
